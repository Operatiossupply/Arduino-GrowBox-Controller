__I do not assume any responsability for any damage to persons, plants or thing by using this software.__

## License

PepperIno is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use this GrowBox firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep it open, and you must provide your compatible source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the license is to make a fork of this project on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (GrowBox, GermBox, Indoor Gardening etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
